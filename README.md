# minesweeper (work in progress)
Mine sweeper app built in rust.
This project is meant to be convert to a WASM and FFI modules for other packages.

## Demo
To run console use `cargo run --example "console"`. This will create a game that is 24x24 tiles.
Too pick a tile simple type in the numeric coordinates `x,y` or `x y`.

*note: console demo was crudely put together and is likely to crash under some case when giving an invalid input.*
